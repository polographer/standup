  <h2>About??</h2>
  <p>This was done in the free time of a few developers trying to find the code-enlightment, I dont think we have achieve it, but we are close </p> 
  <p>Feel free to contact us if you have an interesting project or just to chitchat, autographs are still free</p>
<p>We are planning to do this app opensource, we are just fixing some indentation problems on the views (?), we will be uploading to github as soon as we finish</p>
